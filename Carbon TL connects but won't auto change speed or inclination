This issue is for my Proform Carbon TL (not T7)
My carbon TL connects to QZ App
QZ Apps sees Treadmill and upon manually activating speed and inclination QZ reports back speed and inclination pressed on treadmill
When starting peloton App QZ app connects to peloton account but treadmill speed and inclination do not change
