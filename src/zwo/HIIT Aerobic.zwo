    <description>These intervals are long enough to need significant aerobic energy generation mixing anaerobic work with low end VO2max work. Gastin demonstrates in his review[1] that over 120 seconds, 63% of the work was aerobic. That was at 95% effort, so this will be slightly skewed to anaerobic work in the spikes. If you want more aerobic intervals, see my VO2max intervals. Even so, this will register as Tempo on Garminâ€™s primary benefit category of training impact, with 0 anaerobic training effect.
